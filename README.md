## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

  DigitalVault is a highly secure cloud-based password/card manager that provides robust storage and management of user passwords and cards. It consists of a backend API developed using FastAPI, incorporating industry-standard security measures such as JWT tokens for API security and hashed keys for storing user passwords. The database backend utilizes MariaDB for secure data storage. The website is built with Flask and is reverse proxied with NGINX. The entire application is containerized using Docker for easy deployment, scalability, and enhanced security.
      
## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
All you will need to get started is an updated version of Docker on any system

### Prerequisites
- Docker
- Docker Compose

### Running
The Cloud Vault Manager can be deployed to any environment that supports Docker. By utilizing Docker containers, the deployment process becomes simplified and consistent across different platforms. Follow these steps for deployment:

- Set up a server or cloud instance with Docker installed.
- Clone the project repository to the server.
- Build and start the Docker containers using the provided Docker Compose file.

```
docker-compose build
docker-compose up -d
```


## 🎈 Usage <a name="usage"></a>
Once the Cloud Vault Manager is up and running, users can perform the following actions:

- Register a new account with a unique username and password.
- Log in using the registered credentials, generating a secure JWT token for API authentication.
- Access and manage passwords securely through the user-friendly web interface.
- Generate strong passwords using customizable options for enhanced security.
- Analyze password strength to guide users towards creating robust passwords.
- Retrieve and update stored passwords while maintaining strict access control.
- Update account information and manage security settings.
